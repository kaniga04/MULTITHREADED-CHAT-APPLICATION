DESCRIPTION: This project demonstrates how to build a Client-Server Chat Application in Java using sockets and multithreading to handle multiple users simultaneously. The application allows a server to manage connections from multiple clients, facilitating real-time chat communication between them.

It is an excellent example to understand key concepts in network programming, such as:

Socket Communication: Using ServerSocket for the server and Socket for clients.
Multithreading: Ensuring that the server can handle multiple client connections concurrently.
Input/Output Streams: Reading and writing messages over the network.
